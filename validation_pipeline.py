# There is more and this should get you started: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/metrics
# However it is not about how many metrics you crank out, it is about whether you find the meangingful ones and report on them.
# Think about a system on how to decide which metric to go for..

# You are looking for a great package to generate your reports, let me recommend https://plotly.com/dash/
